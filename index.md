# Complex Research Infrastructure Projects

This is an open blog to share all the lessons I've learned (and seen) over the last 25 years in fintech, IT support, data analytics, research software and digital research infrastructure around Research Data Management, Data Analytics, Digital Skills Training, and Machine Learning.

## Complex problems require hybrid solutions

I was chatting with the lovely folks at Open Life Science recently, and I shared this quote, "Complex problems require hybrid solutions" . This sparked quite a bit of conversation. I was surprised by the reaction because it’s something I think about often.

Too often, people try to solve complex problems with simple solutions, but it’s like squeezing a balloon from one end—problems just pop up on the other side, or it becomes a never-ending game of whack-a-mole where you're always putting out fires but never gaining traction.

In research data management (RDM), this is definitely one of those complex problems that requires a hybrid solution.

So, the real question is: **What kind of hybrid solution will truly solve your complex RDM problem?**

The hybrid approach I advocate for is one that’s scalable *and* useful. It's not about creating something that scales but isn’t practical, or something that’s useful but doesn’t scale. It’s about finding something that is scalable that can be extended so that it becomes useful in many different scenarios - a perfect way to think about RDM solutions.

In fact instead of thinking about an RDM solution you probably want to start thinking about an RDM ecosystem.

Now, when thinking about research automation solutions, instead of asking, “Will this solve my problem?” ask, “How extensible and scalable is this so that it will be useful enough to solve my complex RDM problem?”

Processed data can also be quite big, so similarly, we don’t want to move it either. 
Summarised data is usually smaller, and is used for interactive visualisation and analysis, plus it is easier to share due to its smaller size. 
Data is usually treated as a monolith in Research Data Management (RDM) projects.

But recently I’ve been thinking about breaking it into three separate areas - raw, processed and summarised data sizes.

This allows us to think about 𝗳𝗶𝘁-𝗳𝗼𝗿-𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 with more precision.

Summarised data is usually smaller, and is used for interactive visualisation and analysis, plus it is easier to share due to its smaller size. 

This has really helped us design **the REDMANE ecosystem**.

## ON CORE at the Brisbane Powerhouse 20th of February 2025

**I had a wonderful time at ON Core 2025, hosted by the CSIRO.**

[ON Core connects Australia’s deep tech community](https://wp.csiro.au/oncore/) for a day and I got to hear some really interesting talks but most importantly I got a chance to connect with some very very interesting people! 

I learned early on that they were talking in a different language to me. TTO ([Technical Transfer Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_technology_transfer_offices)) and TRL ([Technology Readiness Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level)), and [Venture Studios](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/06/what-are-venture-studios-and-how-can-they-help-with-climate-innovation/) are all new terms to me but I caught up with the lingo fairly quickly! 

The biggest takeaway of the day for me was that I really enjoy talking with people from a broad range of experiences and working on a broad range of problems. 

I also realised that bringing in more diverse decision makers can increase the returns on investment. 

Now my job is to reach out to those connections that I've made to get a better understanding we can mutually benefit each other.

## Translators - one key role you need for complex projects

Translators have a broad set of skills and knowledge. They are able to guide and connect the non-technical and technical people to ensure everyone is on the same page.

They not only know how to translate between people, but also can push back because they have enough knowledge to know when others have already done it/know that it is possible.

They can narrow down the problem space and find solutions that are beneficial to all vested interests.

![Title: Translators. A "translator" (or glue-person) sits at the center of complex projects and creates authentic, concrete communication between stakeholders. They translate, collaborate, and challenge assumptions. They are generalists with good knowledge, experience, and skills across multiple areas who like to connect people and collaborate. Picture of a person in the middle of a list of roles: 
Legal Staff
Grants Staff
Financial Staff
Governance Staff
Ethics and Integrity
Health Researchers
Data Stewards
Data Curators
Researchers
Trainers
Software Developers
Service Providers
IT sysadmins
IT Security
Helpdesk
Funders
Sponsors
Project Staff
Project Managers
Change Managers
