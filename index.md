# Complex Research Infrastructure Projects

This is an open blog to share all the lessons I've learned (and seen) over the last 25 years in fintech, IT support, data analytics, research software and digital research infrastructure around Research Data Management, Data Analytics, Digital Skills Training, and Machine Learning.

## ON CORE at the Brisbane Powerhouse 20th of February 2025

**I had a wonderful time at ON Core 2025, hosted by the CSIRO.**

[ON Core connects Australiaâ€™s deep tech community](https://wp.csiro.au/oncore/) for a day and I got to hear some really interesting talks but most importantly I got a chance to connect with some very very interesting people! 

I learned early on that they were talking in a different language to me. TTO ([Technical Transfer Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_technology_transfer_offices)) and TRL ([Technology Readiness Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level)), and [Venture Studios](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/06/what-are-venture-studios-and-how-can-they-help-with-climate-innovation/) are all new terms to me but I caught up with the lingo fairly quickly! 

The biggest takeaway of the day for me was that I really enjoy talking with people from a broad range of experiences and working on a broad range of problems. 

I also realised that bringing in more diverse decision makers can increase the returns on investment. 

Now my job is to reach out to those connections that I've made to get a better understanding we can mutually benefit each other.

## Translators - one key role you need for complex projects

Translators have a broad set of skills and knowledge. They are able to guide and connect the non-technical and technical people to ensure everyone is on the same page.

They not only know how to translate between people, but also can push back because they have enough knowledge to know when others have already done it/know that it is possible.

They can narrow down the problem space and find solutions that are beneficial to all vested interests.

![Title: Translators. A "translator" (or glue-person) sits at the center of complex projects and creates authentic, concrete communication between stakeholders. They translate, collaborate, and challenge assumptions. They are generalists with good knowledge, experience, and skills across multiple areas who like to connect people and collaborate.

Legal Staff
Grants Staff
Financial Staff
Governance Staff
Ethics and Integrity
Health Researchers
Data Stewards
Data Curators
Researchers
Trainers
Software Developers
Service Providers
IT sysadmins
IT Security
Helpdesk
Funders
Sponsors
Project Staff
Project Managers
Change Managers
