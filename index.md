# Complex Research Infrastructure Projects

This is an open blog to share all the lessons I've learned (and seen) over the last 25 years in fintech, IT support, data analytics, research software and digital research infrastructure around Research Data Management, Data Analytics, Digital Skills Training, and Machine Learning.


## Translators - one key role you need for complex projects

Translators have a broad set of skills and knowledge. They are able to guide and connect the non-technical and technical people to ensure everyone is on the same page.

They not only know how to translate between people, but also can push back because they have enough knowledge to know when others have already done it/know that it is possible.

They can narrow down the problem space and find solutions that are beneficial to all vested interests.

![Title: Translators. A "translator" (or glue-person) sits at the center of complex projects and creates authentic, concrete communication between stakeholders. They translate, collaborate, and challenge assumptions. They are generalists with good knowledge, experience, and skills across multiple areas who like to connect people and collaborate.

Legal Staff
Grants Staff
