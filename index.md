# Blog for my thoughts on RDM, Data Analytics, Digital Skills Training, and Complex Research Infrastructure Projects

I have 25 years experience in IT and 13 years experience in designing, developing and implementing many different data analytics and data engineering solutions with a strong focus on customer service. This includes advanced data analytics platforms, research data management and discovery systems, digital skills training, and generally managing complex research infrastructure projets and multi-disciplinary teams. 

I have managed over $50 million in projects and delivered an estimated $230 million worth of economics benefit, established and led 4 data analytics / multi-disciplinary teams. Creating buy-in with skeptical stakeholders in the data analytics and engineering space is my specialty.  

I have achieved all this because I also focus on the non-technical needs of solutions, such as change management, training, grassroots awareness raising, and recruitment of multi-disciplinary implementation teams. I have seen first-hand how new health research infrastructure and services are underutilised when grassroots staff are cynical, distrustful or unaware of options. 

I explain my methodologies that extend best practice with the rest of the data analytics and data engineering community. With 15,000+ views and 1,700+ downloads, they span a wide range of areas including digital health solutions, how to build high-performing data analytics teams, new types of communities of practice, and organisational development. I have shared these as an international keynote and as a supervisor to over 200 Data Science and Engineering students.
